### 1. MACD Zero-Cross Strategy https://www.
When the MACD crosses from below the zero line, it is considered a bullish signal. If it crosses from above the zero line, it is considered a bearish signal.

To test this, we can iterate through a series of stock prices and their MACD histogram. When the MACD line crosses the signal line from below, we buy the stock, when it crosses from above, we sell the stock.
